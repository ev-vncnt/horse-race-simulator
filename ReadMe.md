**ECS414U Horse Race Simulator Project**

This is my Horse Race Simulator Project for the Object Oriented Programming module.

Use HorseRace.java as the main class to run the program.

Horse.java contains the Horse class.

Race.java contains the race class which contains all attributes and functions needed to interact with the race.

Part 2 is under construction.
