# ECS414U Horse Race Simulator Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my submission for the ECS414U Object Oriented Program project - a simple Horse Racing Game. This program simulates 3 horses running on a track. Each horse has it's own name, icon and confidence level. The horses can be customised using a GUI before the race is displayed in the terminal window. 

## Setup and Usage

To run my game, the Java Development Kit (JDK) is required. This can be installed from the [official download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/). 

Clone my repository by running this command in your terminal:

```git clone https://github.com/ev-vncnt/horse-race-simulator.git```

Then, navigate to the main directory using: 

```cd horse-race-simulator```

To simply run an example race, move into Part1

```cd Part1``` 

and then run the HorseRace.java file.

If you would prefer to use the graphical interface to customise the horses before running the race, navigate into Part2

```cd Part2```

and run HorseRaceGUI.java. 

Within the GUI window, you can customise each horse by enterring a new name, changing the icon, or using the slider to adjust the horses confidence.

Once you have finished customising the horses, start the race by pressing the "Start Race" button. You will see the horses moving along the track and the winning horses name will be shown.

## Notes

In some terminals, Unicode icons or emojis are unsupported, so the user may not see some of the icons or emojis that are used to represent the horses.

The confidence level decides how likely a horse is to move forward or fall over, therefore disqualifying it from the race. A higher confidence means the horse is less likely to fall and more likely to have consistent performance in the race.
